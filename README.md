# BOA IMAGE CONVERTER
The name _Boa_ comes from a snake which is, apparently, the most similar to a python.

_Get it... because this program is written in Python...? Nevermind._

## Overview
Ever had a situation where the image you want to use for your program is in a weird format like HEIC (iPhone users can relate)? Need to quickly convert images without spending ages trying to find a "HEIC to [_image type_]" converter on the Web? The intention of this program is to be an easy executable file that allows you to quickly convert images into different formats, hopefully retaining the same quality as the original.
