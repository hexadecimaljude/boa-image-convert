# BOA IMAGE CONVERTER

The name of this program comes from a snake which is supposedly the most similar to a Python. Anyway, enough of the stupid puns.

This is just a simple project of mine that I randomly came up with - I genuinely don't remember how! It allows you to change image formats through the command line.

May not be the best thing in the world, but I hope you try it out and enjoy it. :)
